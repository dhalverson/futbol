Futbol Project - Norma Lopez, Cam C, Dan Halverson

Design Strategy

We have our project structured into 5 main groups:

- Game, Team, and Game Team files
- Game, Season, Team, and League stats
- Collection files
- Stat Tracker file
- Module file

The game, team, and game team files initialize the attributes from the CSV for a single row

The game, season, team, and league stats are where the methods are build, and may include helper methods

The collection files read the CSV and creates row objects

The stat tracker file houses all the methods

The module file holds a method that is used across several different stats classes that share behavior of calculating averages within several methods
